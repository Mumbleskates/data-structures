# data-structures

## This project contains sample code for implementing the following structures:

### Queue

This data structure, a Queue, is an abstract data type or a linear data structure, in which the first element is 
inserted from one end called REAR(or tail), and the deletion of existing element takes place from the other end 
called as FRONT(or head).

### Doubly Linked List

This data structure is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each 
node contains two fields, called _next and _prev, that are references to the previous(_prev) and to the next(_next) node 
in the sequence of nodes.

### Stack

This data structure that allows for a Last In First Out (LIFO) access to a collection of objects (nodes), each containing
a link to its successor and a piece of data. Access is given through the methods push(), adding an item to the stack,
or pop(), removing an item from the stack.


### Linked List

This data structure has an ordered set of data elements (nodes), each containing a link to its successor and a piece of data.
