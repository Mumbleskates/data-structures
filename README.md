# data-structures

## This project contains sample code for implementing the following structures:

### Doubly Linked List

This data structure is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each 
node contains two fields, called _next and _prev, that are references to the previous(_prev) and to the next(_next) node 
in the sequence of nodes.

### Stack

This data structure that allows for a Last In First Out (LIFO) access to a collection of objects (nodes), each containing
a link to its successor and a piece of data. Access is given through the methods push(), adding an item to the stack,
or pop(), removing an item from the stack.


### Linked List

This data structure has an ordered set of data elements (nodes), each containing a link to its successor and a piece of data.
