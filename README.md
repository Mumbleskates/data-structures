# data-structures

## This project contains sample code for implementing the following structures:

### Binary Heap

This data structure, Heap, is a specialized tree-based data structure that 
satisfies the heap property: If A is a parent node of B then the key of 
node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B with the same ordering 
applying across the heap. Fills from left to right. There are minHeap 
and maxHeap alternatives.


### Deque

This data structure, Deque (usually pronounced like "deck"), is an irregular acronym of double-ended 
queue. Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or 
contracted on both ends (either its FRONT(head) or REAR(tail)).

### Queue

This data structure, a Queue, is an abstract data type or a linear data structure, in which the first element is 
inserted from one end called REAR(or tail), and the deletion of existing element takes place from the other end 
called as FRONT(or head).

### Doubly Linked List

This data structure is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each 
node contains two fields, called _next and _prev, that are references to the previous(_prev) and to the next(_next) node 
in the sequence of nodes.

### Stack

This data structure that allows for a Last In First Out (LIFO) access to a collection of objects (nodes), each containing
a link to its successor and a piece of data. Access is given through the methods push(), adding an item to the stack,
or pop(), removing an item from the stack.


### Linked List

This data structure has an ordered set of data elements (nodes), each containing a link to its successor and a piece of data.
