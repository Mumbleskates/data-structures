# data-structures

## This project contains sample code for implementing the following structures:


### Stack

This data structure that allows for a Last In First Out (LIFO) access to a collection of objects (nodes), each containing
a link to its successor and a piece of data. Access is given through the methods push(), adding an item to the stack,
or pop(), removing an item from the stack.


### Linked List

This data structure has an ordered set of data elements (nodes), each containing a link to its successor and a piece of data.
