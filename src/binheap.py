#TODO: .push(): puts a new value into the heap, maintaining the heap property.
#TODO: .pop(): removes the “top” value in the heap, maintaining the heap property.

# You will need to implement some private api in order to support those operations.

# The constructor for your heap should default to creating an empty heap, but allow for
# creating a populated given an iterable as an input.

# For each feature of your heap, start by writing tests to demonstrate that feature. Then
# implement the code to pass the tests.
